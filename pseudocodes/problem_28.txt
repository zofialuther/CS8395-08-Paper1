Pseudocode:

Set n to the length of s
Set ans to 0
Create a new HashMap called map
Set end to 0
Set start to 0

WHILE end is less than n
  Set alpha to the character at s at index end
  IF map contains the key alpha
    Set start to the maximum of map.get(alpha) and start
  Set ans to the maximum of ans and end - start + 1
  Set map at the key s.charAt(end) to end + 1
  Increment end

RETURN ans
