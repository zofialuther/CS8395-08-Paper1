This program takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the maximum sum of all subarrays of the given array. The program first checks if the length of the array is 0, in which case it returns 0. It then sets the maximum so far and the current maximum to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the array, setting the current maximum to the greater of the current element or the sum of the current element and the current maximum. Finally, the program returns the maximum of the current maximum and the maximum so far.
