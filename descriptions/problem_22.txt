This program intersects two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, and returns a new array composed of the elements that appear in both arrays. It does this by sorting the arrays, then looping through each array and checking if the elements at the same index are equal. If so, it adds the element from `nums1` to the new array, then increments both the index of `nums1` and `nums2`. If not, it only increments the index of the array with the smaller element. Finally, it returns a copy of the new array, from the beginning of the new array up to the number of elements it encountered.
