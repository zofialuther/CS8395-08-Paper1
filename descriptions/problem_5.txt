This program takes an array of strings as a parameter and returns an array of strings. It sorts the array of strings using a custom sorting algorithm that compares the integer values of each string and returns the strings in ascending order based on the integer values. If two strings have the same integer values, the string with the lower alphabetical order will be returned first.
