This program merges two given int arrays, nums1 and nums2, into one larger array. The parameters m and n denote the respective lengths of the two arrays. It begins by starting at the last elements of both arrays, and then compares them. The larger of the two elements is placed into the larger array, and the index of the larger array is then decremented. This process is repeated until one of the two arrays is completely merged into the larger array. The program returns nothing.
