This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a given array of two integers. It uses an iterative approach to calculate the greatest common divisor of the two given numbers, first setting the first number in the array as the first value, and the second number in the array as the second value. The program then enters a while loop, which will continue until the second value is equal to 0. Inside the loop, the second value is set to the result of the first value modulo the second value, and the first value is set to the previous second value. The program then returns the final value of the first value, which is the GCD of the two numbers.
