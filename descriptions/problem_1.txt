This program checks if a given String is a palindrome. It takes in a single String parameter and returns a boolean. First, it converts the String to lowercase and removes all non-alphanumeric characters. Then it sets two variables - one at the beginning of the String, and one at the end. It checks each character from the beginning to the end of the String for equality, and if they are not equal, it returns false. If all characters are equal, it returns true.
