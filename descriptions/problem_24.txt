This program takes a string as a parameter and returns the index of the first unique character in the string. It keeps track of the frequency of each character in the string by creating an array of size 26 to store the count. It then iterates through the string to check the frequency of each character. If the frequency of a character is 1, it returns the index of the character, otherwise it returns -1.
