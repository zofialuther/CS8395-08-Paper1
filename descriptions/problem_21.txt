This program merges two sorted arrays of integers, nums1 and nums2, into one combined array. It takes four parameters, nums1 and nums2 as integers arrays, and m and n as integers representing the lengths of the two arrays respectively. It does not return any value, as it mutates the original nums1 array. The program works by iterating through both arrays in descending order and comparing the elements at each index. If the element in nums1 is greater than the element in nums2, the element from nums1 is added to the end of the nums1 array. If the element in nums2 is greater, it is added to the end of the nums1 array. If all elements from nums2 have been added, the loop ends and the program is complete.
