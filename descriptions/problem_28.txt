This program returns the length of the longest substring of the given string 's' without repeating characters. It creates a Map to store the characters encountered in the string, and a counter to keep track of the current substring length. It then iterates through each character in the string, checking if it has been seen before. If it has, the start index is updated to the previous character's index in the map. The program then updates the current substring length and updates the map with the current character's index. The program returns the length of the longest substring found.
