This program takes in a string as a parameter, and returns a boolean value. It uses a stack to track opening parentheses in the input string. For each character in the string, if it is an opening parentheses, it is pushed onto the stack. If it is a closing parentheses, the top element of the stack is popped off and compared to the closing parentheses. If the top element is not an opening parentheses, the method returns false. Finally, the method returns true if the stack is empty, indicating that all of the brackets were properly balanced.
